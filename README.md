# SEE Modes for GiellaLT

This repo holds syntax modes for [SubEthaEdit](https://subethaedit.net) (SEE among friends) for the following types of text files:

* [ConstraintGrammar](https://visl.sdu.dk/cg3.html)
* Corpus analysis (Constraint Grammar output)
* [JSPWiki](https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org/Wiki.jsp?page=TextFormattingRules) (this mode will
  soon be of less interest as most documents are now converted to Markdown)
* [LexC](https://fomafst.github.io/morphtut.html)
* Twolc
* Typos
* Xfst

They are a.o. used in the development of language resources in the [GiellaLT infrastructure](https://github.com/giellalt).

**LexC**, **Twolc** and **Xfst** are tools & formalisms by Xerox. The tools are freely available at <https://web.stanford.edu/~laurik/fsmbook/home.html> (although closed-source), and both the tools and formalisms are documented in the book linked to on that site. The same formalisms are supported by the open-source tools [**Foma**](https://fomafst.github.io) and [**Hfst**](https://hfst.github.io), ie they are source-code compatible with the Xerox tools.

**Typos** files are simple TAB separated, two column files containing real typos and their corrections. These files are used for testing spelling checkers, and the syntax colouring helps us check that the content is entered correctly.
