    *) syntax colouring:
        - Tweaked GT style tag colouring

Changes with Version 1.6
    *) syntax colouring:
        - Added initial support for Apertium-style tags.

Changes with Version 1.5
    *) syntax colouring:
        - Corrected some errors regarding infostrings:
            - empty infostrings caused the cont.lex to be uncoloured
            - more than one whitespace char caused the cont.lex to be
              uncoloured

Changes with Version 1.4
    *) syntax colouring:
        - smaller corrections regarding short upper and lower strings
        - corrected border colouring
        - first attempt at support for Flag diacritics - working, but
          destroying upper/lower colouring if such context is present

Changes with Version 1.3
    *) syntax colouring:
        - multiple tags in a row are now coloured correctly and consistently

Changes with Version 1.2
    *) syntax colouring:
        - upper & lower: now also gets correctly coloured when
          they contain %-escaped characters, such as spaces
        - continuation lexicons: now also coloured when followed by
          an info string

Changes with Version 1.1
    *) EXTENSIONS: removed .txt, since too many files would match
    *) syntax colouring: much improved, support for:
        - upper
        - continuation lexicons
        - digraphs of the form [A-Z][1-9], e.g. X3
        - triggers of the form %^[1-9]?[a-z]?[A-Z]+, e.g. %^DISIMPL
        - borders %> and %»
        - Multichar_Symbols
        - tags of the form \+[\w/]+, e.g. +Sg or +Der/Pass
    *) syntax colouring: hopefully better colours

Know bugs as of 1.2:
    *) symbols show up briefly on the symbols menu, but then disappear, and
       are replaced by the string <No Selected Symbol>
    *) the first lexicon after Multichar_Symbols is not coloured
    *) flag diacritics causes miscolouring of the surrounding upper/lower
    *) the colour scheme is probably not entirely standard, improvements welcome
